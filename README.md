<h1>Currently, the development is in beta version.</h1>

<h1>Purpose</h1>
The goal of this project is to encode and decode text on photos. Coding takes place according to the principle of the binary system, that is, letters are converted to the binary system. There is no decryption yet.

<h1>Extensions used</h1>
I used:
* python - for writing scripts
* pyscript - so that these scripts can be displayed on a web page
